This is a simple Python program that encrypts and decrypts messages using a randomly generated substitution cipher.

## How it works

- The program generates a random mapping of characters by shuffling a list of:
  - space
  - punctuation
  - digits
  - uppercase and lowercase letters
- When you enter a message, it encrypts it by substituting each character based on the shuffled key.
- You can then enter the encrypted message to decrypt it back to the original.
